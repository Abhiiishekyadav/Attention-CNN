This is customly created dataset consisting 13 classes of objects, viz. pedestrian, person, car, van, bus, truck, motor, bicycle, awning-tricycle, and tricycle like features.
It was assembled in three steps: 
extracting frames from videos using CV2 and Tkinter libraries, detecting objects with the VGG16 model, and labeling each object with bounding boxes. The object detection performed by
VGG16 produces a bounding box across the objects with different colors, which helps manually label the bounding boxes for desired classes. 
This process resulted in 1,301 data points.
